# Heart-Attack-Prediction


Heart attacks are the main reason for the sudden death of people in many
countries. And this kind of sudden heart attack can put the whole family in
the worst possible situation when the familyâ€™s head is affected by this sudden heart attack. The best way to reduce the number of sudden deaths from
a heart attack is to predict the heart attack before something bad happens.
This study uses machine learning to perform predictive analysis to predict
whether people are more likely to have a heart attack. The purpose of the
prediction is to find the optimal classification algorithm that accurately predicts people who are prone to heart attack in advance.
